% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction} \label{intro}
Internet has been considered as one of the vital factors for the development of society due to its functions to every field of life. Starting from 1965, the first wide-area computer network was built by Lawrence G. Roberts – MIT Researcher, based on the connection between the TX-2 computer in Mass and the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line \cite{historyofinternet}. This was the evidence of the ability of communicating between the time-shared computers, running programs or accessing data between them. After that, as the technology continued to improve, this kind of information infrastructure was evolved in different aspects such as speed, adaptation or security. As a result of creating and developing of organizational structures, the influences of Internet reach not only the communication between computers but entire society in many fields using online tools for other purposes as well \cite{historyofinternet}. 

As the society evolves, the needs of transferring large data between people through the use of Internet does also.  Due to some disadvantages of Client-Server networking, the new kind of mechanism for accessing and retrieving files from one computer to the others named peer-to-peer file sharing was invented and used widely \cite{clientserver}. And the first name of software envisioning this process is Napster created in 1991, followed by the development of Kazaa and BitTorrent. This also leads to many of issues in society and the major point the authors would like to mention in this paper is the copyright materials transferred through this method. According to our research from the relative works which are discussed in the third section, Vietnam is one of the countries which are commonplace for this phenomenon because of peoples lack of knowledge and awareness in this country. Therefore, we the authors choose Vietnam as a turning point to debate this problem using theories and principles of ethics.

In section II, we would like to discuss about the general information and knowledge about peer-to-peer file sharing and its related concepts. There are also information about the works relating to our ethical issue. In section III, we present about the methods we based on, which are the main theories in ethic, and discuss the problems based on these theories. For a more throughout explanation regarding our works, please refer to this section. In section IV, we conclude our works based on the discussion in section III.

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the

% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically

% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.


\section{Background and Related Work} \label{background}
\subsection{Background}
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network consist of 2 or more PCs, which are called "peers". Peers share their resource such as bandwidth, processing power, disk space with the network, without need a centralized server. \cite{schollmeier2001definition}

Peer-to-Peer file sharing is the distribution and sharing file using Peer-to-peer network. To download, you will need a software rather than a traditional web browser \cite{HowBitTorrentWorks}. In peer-to-peer file sharing, you download from peers who has the file, or part of its, rather from centralized server. Then when you has the file, you upload it to other peers who need the file. \cite{HowP2PWorks}

In 1999, peer-to-peer file sharing is popular with Napster. Napster use central servers that link user who has the files with who has the file. Then two users would transfer the file privately, but only music file. \cite{tyson2005old}. Later, Napster was shutdown due to copyright infringement in July 2001 \cite{douglas2004copyright}.

After Napster, the second generation peer-to-peer file sharing, like Kazaa, that do not use central server. \cite{watson2008kazaa}  


BitTorrent is a Peer-to-Peer sharing protocol which was release on July 2, 2001 \cite{cohen2001bittorrent}. Similar to Napster, Bittorent use central server called tracker\cite{HowP2PWorks}. To upload, uploader will create a .torrent file which contain information about the file, tracker will store these infomation. Downloader will download .torrent file, and use these information find peers with the helps of tracker which can be hosted by anyone \cite{HowP2PWorks}. Althoght BitTorrent need tracker as central server, multiple  tracker can exist, as any .torrent can be register with multiple trackers, make BitTorrent less central vulnerability \cite{HowP2PWorks}. Bittorent also has DHT, Local Peer Discovery, Peer exchange reduce the dependency on central server. Hence, it is difficult to take down file while it is already on the network.   




\subsection{Related work}
There are many research article and law about BitTorrent and pirate, copyright infringement. Bright, Stephen explain why BitTorrent is not effect by international law \cite{bright2011current}. G Douglas's Copyright and Peer-To-Peer Music File Sharing: The Napster Case and the Argument Against Legislative Reform study Napster case, which is shut down due to copyright infringement \cite{douglas2004copyright}. Siganos, Georgos and Pujol, Josep M and Rodriguez, Pablo prove that BitTorrent can be minitored \cite{siganos2009monitoring}.

\section{Methodology} \label{method}
In this section, we evaluate the ethics issues of BitTorrent.

\subsection{Subjective Relativism}
According to Subjective Relativism, user participating in the networking community has the right to decide for himself or herself the concept of right and wrong, which are the ones they see fit \cite{quinn2014ethics} . Using Bittorrent, in particular, is really the one they find it easy to send or retrieve files on the Internet regardless of the others’ opinions even though it is copyrighted materials; they only choose the straight forward ways for themselves get data they want since they see that it would be a way to help them save money. In contrast, in term of the aspect of owners, they would think that the action of sharing their creative works is completely wrong; it could be considered as an unethical issue in their opinion.

\subsection{Cultural Relativism}
Regarding the theory of Cultural Relativism, the actual moral guidelines of a society is actually the one deciding the concepts of right and wrong \cite{quinn2014ethics}. Instead of remaining stable in the same period of time, it presents differently from place to place. In fact, the issue of using Bittorrent to download and upload copyrighted materials that could be considered wrong in a society may not be really the wrong one in other society. On the one hand, this is true in the situation of Switzerland, which is called “The safest country for downloading torrent” \cite{safesttorrent}. Especially, Vietnamese are used to violent copyright that they use copyrighted material for both personal and commerce.
. The downloading of copyrighted content through file sharing services (Bittorrent) is a little bit more risky in Canada after enacting mandatory data logging and monitoring by Internet Providers and VPN service providers which affect Canadian bittorrent users who were previously allowed to download torrents largely without issue\cite{canadadataretention}.  On the other hand, considering other countries comprising USA… this action is totally wrong according to the government’s laws of these countries \cite{copyrightlawusa}.


\subsection{Divine Command theory}
As regard to Divine Command theory in ethic, every action which is considered wrong is the one that
contraries the will of God and every right action would be the one that obeys the will of God \cite{quinn2014ethics}. In fact, there are a number of holy books that are contributed to various regions, translated into different languages and it also cannot address all moral problems that can be faced with in real society. However, when dealing with the problem of copyright violation, there are actually plenty of sentences that bible says about intellectual property since the problem of treating another’s property or acting toward people in the society are really mentioned a lot in holy books. For instance, "You shall not steal.” \cite{exodus2015} or “Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor's landmark”\cite{deuteronomy2717} are the ones related to the action violating intellectual copyright \cite{bibleip}. Therefore,  piracy is totally wrong.

\subsection{Kantianism}
In regards to the theory of Kantianism, actions of people are considered right if it is guided by moral laws which are universal. In order to decide whether a moral rule is appropriate, Kant proposed two formulas of Categorical Imperative \cite{quinn2014ethics}. Using the first formulation, it could be true that Bittorrent users in Vietnam who sharing copyrighted contents are using other’s creative works as a means to an end. It means that they do not care ether other’s interest or the result of their actions; they would like to save their money from purchasing contents such as music or movies which can be downloaded easily and quickly using P2P services. 



\subsection{Act Utilitarianism}
As regards Act Utilitarianism theory, the Greatest Happiness Principle, a good action is the one whose net effect is to produce more happiness than unhappiness and otherwise \cite{quinn2014ethics}. According to the situation of problem, the authors would like to debate this problem based on its benefits. Considering the case of downloading a copyrighted movie on the Internet using Bittorrent and this movie have not been released on the television yet. Most of people download and watch it because they would like to see it as soon as possible. As expected, after the movie is showed on the television, there are only a small number of views who did not watch it from downloading. As a results, this could affect the development of companies of communication dramatically even have a big impact on the weak companies’ survival, causing unemployment as well as influencing the economy of country. This could be said that the drawbacks of this actions outweigh its benefits, so the action of downloading copyrighted materials is not accepted in this ethical theory.
\cite{bittorentmedia}


\subsection{Rule Utilitarianism}
According to the ethical theory of Rule Utilitarianism applying the Principle of Utility to moral rules, an action is morally right if it is followed by everyone, leading to the greatest increase in total happiness \cite{quinn2014ethics}. In this case, the authors would like to discuss the moral rule of downloading copyrighted contents from Bittorrent. On the side of Bittorrent users, retrieving copyrighted contents could save them money and they could use that money to improve their standard living. Another advantage is that it could lead to generate new revenue streams, free access to cultural materials and learning \cite{bittorenethics} . On the other side, this problem could lead to enormous impacts on the number of copyrighted contents as well as its owners such as artist, singer… They would not want to produce their creative products without receiving any profits since they may have problem with their finance if they continue to do so or they do not have any motivation in. Besides that, another negative effect of using Bittorrent is that users’ computer could be monitored by others, providing viruses easily into their network \cite{bittorendanger}. Altogether, it could be seen that people’s happiness would be decreased. Hence, this theory does not accept this model rule.

\subsection{Social Contract}
Social contract is a voluntary agreement between individuals for their mutual benefit. \cite{quinn2014ethics}. There is the social contract between who intellectual property creator and society. Intellectual property (IP) creator create IP for society to use , then he should has something in return. For example, a writer write a novel, then he should get money for selling his books. Then he can feed himself, his family and continue to write novel for society. Both reader and the author himself have benefit. However, when people pirate on intellectual property, it violent social contract, because you use their creation without give them anything in return. At the end, people would see that creating intellectual property give them no benefit which lead to nobody want to creating IP for there living. Hence, we would not have movie to watch at all, if we keep pirating movie from  the pirate bay.
